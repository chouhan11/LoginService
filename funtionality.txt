Spring-Boot-JWT-Authentication with OpenApi integration documentation.

we are disabling spring security for One Rest-endPoint i.e /authenticate
for generating JWT- token.

Step to run App::
 1:: hit   http://localhost:9090/   endpoint with GET method and content-Type is application/json.
     you will get 
  {
    "timestamp": "...........",
    "status": 403,
    "error": "Forbidden",
    "message": "Access Denied",
    "path": "/"
  } 
 
 2:: hit http://localhost:9090/authenticate endpoint with POST method and content-Type is application/json and 
     in the Body provide username and pass.. in json format i.e
     {
	   "userName" :"Madhur",
	   "password":"1092"
     }
     you will get JWT-token i.e 
     eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJNYWRodXIiLCJleHAiOjE1OTU5NjEzMDcsImlhdCI6MTU5NTkyNTMwN30.fjbEkYyWk7IAKXfDlzMY374fhB2IFlRPg_5JcWlrbJU
     
     which contain header,username,pass.., signature-key and algo... for generating JWT-token.
     
 3:: after verifying client , they can access end Apis of our application  with this JWT-token
      hit again  http://localhost:9090/   endpoint with GET method and header provide two keys
       ==   content-Type is application/json
       ==   Authorization is "Bearer your-JWT-token"
